# sariska-ios-sdk-releases

### Note:

The repo is home to two different dependencies. Depending on what platform you are using this repo for, the branch may differ.

For a working release:

iOS written in Swift: branch name is ios

iOS written in Unity: branch name is master

Plan is to make two different repos in the future in order to clear this confusion.
